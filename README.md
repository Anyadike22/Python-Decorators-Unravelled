##What are Decorators?
Decorators in Python are functions that enhance the behavior of other functions or classes at runtime. They are indicated by the '@' symbol followed by the decorator function name. Decorators enable the addition of functionality to existing code or the creation of more flexible and reusable code. They wrap one piece of code with another, modifying behavior by either adding functionality like logging or timing to functions or enforcing rules on classes. By separating cross-cutting concerns into separate functions, decorators help avoid clutter in the main codebase and facilitate easy modification or removal of added functionality later.
